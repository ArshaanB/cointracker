Given the Git context of files changed:

1. read the changes in each file and put together a short commit message (print each of these)
2. combine all the short commit messages into 1 medium sized commit message (print each of these)
3. do the above 3 times and provide me with the 3 final outputs

Remember:

- It can be technical since developers will read it.
- Be specific, mention functions and file names if it helps.
